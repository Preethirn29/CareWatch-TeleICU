## Problem Statement
Innovative Monitoring System for TeleICU Patients Using Video Processing and Deep Learning
## Overview
The **TeleICU Monitoring System** uses advanced video processing and deep learning to improve patient care in intensive care units (ICUs). This system helps doctors and nurses monitor patients remotely, ensuring safety and quick response to any issues.
## Technologies Used
-Python: Programming language used for scripting, data processing, and training models. <br>
-YOLOv10 (You Only Look Once, Version 10): Object detection model to identify and localize multiple objects in images. It offers features such as real time performance, high accuracy, pre-trained weights for faster convergence, and flexibility for customization. <br>
-Libraries: Utilizes libraries like os for file operations and urllib for downloading files. <br>
-Huggingface Hub: Platform for accessing pre-trained models. <br>
-Annotation Tools: Tools for manually labeling images with bounding. <br>
-CUDA and cuDNN: Technologies from NVIDIA for accelerating deep learning computations. <br>
-OpenCV: Library for real-time computer vision tasks, Used for video processing, frame extraction, and pre-processing tasks. <br>
-Deep Learning Frameworks: Frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow for training and deploying neural networks. YOLOv10 is built on PyTorch, facilitating training and inference. <br>
-YAML: Configuration file format for specifying training parameters and datasets. Custom data configuration for YOLOv10 training (custom_data.yaml). <br>
-Shell Commands: Commands executed in the shell to clone repositories, install packages, and run training/prediction scripts. pip install, !yolo commands for YOLOv10 operations. <br>
## Future Scope
Future enhancements could include incorporating multi-class detection for more detailed role identification, integrating audio analysis for comprehensive monitoring, and leveraging edge computing for real-time processing. Additionally, continuous model updates with new data and expanding the system to other hospital units could further enhance its utility and accuracy.
